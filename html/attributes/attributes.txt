Note: 01
	Always use lowercase Attributes
	The Attributes can be written with uppercase or lowercase like title or 
	TITLE, but using lowercase is a better way.

Note 02
	Single or Double Quotes
	Double Quotes around the attributes are the most common in HTML, 
	but Single Quotes can also be used.
Example:
	<p title="This is a title">title with single quotes</p>
	<p title='This is a title'>title with single quotes</p>

Note 03
	When the attribute value itself contains Double Quotes, then it is necessary
	to use Single Quotes:
Example:
<p title="This is a 'TITLE'">title with single quotes</p>
<p title='This is a "TITLE"'>title with double quotes</p>
