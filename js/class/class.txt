What is constructor?
	The constructor is a special method.
	It has to have the exact name "constructor".
	It is executed automatically when a new object is created.
	It is used to initialize object properties.
syntax:
constructor(org1, org2, org3) {
	this.prop1 = org1;
	this.prop2 = org2;
	this.prop3 = org3;
}
Example:
constructor(employeeId, email, phoneNumber) {
	this.employeeId = employeeId;
	this.email = email;
	this.phoneNumber = phoneNumber;
}
