What is an Object?
	Object is an instance of a class. Object is a physical entity.
	Without class, we can't create an object.
	Object is an entity having state and behavior (properties and methods).
	JavaScript is an object-based language. 
	Everything is an object in javascript.

How many ways we can create an Object?
	1.By using curly braces.
	2.By using Object class and new keyword.
	3.By using Class constructor and new keyword.
--
1.By using curly braces
Syntax:
	let object = {property1: value1, property2: value2, propertyn: valuen}
	property and value is separated by :
	property and value combination is separated by ,
Example:
	const employee = {id:102,name:"Ravi Kumar",salary:40000}
--
2.By using Object class and new keyword
	Here, new keyword is used to create object.
Syntax:
	const emp = new Object();  
Example:
	let emp1 = new Object(); 
	emp.id = 101;  
	emp.name = "Aswini";  
	emp.salary = 50000;  
	console.log( emp.id +" "+ emp.name +" "+ emp.salary );

3.By using an Class constructor and new keyword
	Here, you need to create function with arguments. 
	Each argument value can be assigned in the current object by using this 
	keyword.
	The this keyword refers to the current object.
Example
	function employee(id, name, salary){  
		this.id = id;  
		this.name = name;  
		this.salary = salary;  
	}  
	const vimal = new employee(103,"Vimal Jaiswal",30000); 7893qwer
	const kamal = new employee(104,"Kamal Kumar",30000); 9871qiuyt
	const Raj = new employee(105,"Raj Kumar",30000); 4562qiuyt
	console.log(vimal.id+" "+vimal.name+" "+vimal.salary);
