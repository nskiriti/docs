JavaScript Comparison Operators?
Comparison operators can be used in conditional statements to compare values and
take action depending on the result.
	Operator	Description
	   ==		equal to
	   ===		equal value and equal type
	   !=		not equal
	   !==		not equal value or equal type
	   >		greater than
	   <		less than
	   >=		greater than or equal to
	   <=		less than or equal to

Boolean is the result
	All comparison operators return a boolean value:
		true	- means "yes", "correct", or "the truth".
		false	- means "no", "wrong", or "not the truth".

String Comparison
	To compare Strings, JavaScript uses the "dictionary" or “lexicographical” 
	order.
	In other words, strings are compared letter-by-letter.
	Example:
		let x = "Hello";
		let y = "Hi";
		console.log(x > y); //false
		console.log(x < y); //true
		
		These lines compare the string values of x and y using the greater than (>) and less than (<) operators.

		•  String Comparison: In JavaScript, strings are compared based on their Unicode values, character by character.

		•  "Hello" has the Unicode values: H (72), e (101), l (108), l (108), o (111)

		•  "Hi" has the Unicode values: H (72), i (105)

		•  Comparison Result:

		•  x > y evaluates to false because the first differing character is e (101) in "Hello" and i (105) in "Hi". Since 101 is less than 105, "Hello" is considered less than "Hi".

		•  x < y evaluates to true for the same reason.

Note:
	For instance, case matters. A capital letter "A" is not equal to the 
	lowercase "a". 
	Which one is greater? The lowercase "a".
	Because the lowercase character has a greater index in the internal encoding
	table JavaScript uses(Unicode).
