Adding JavaScript Strings?
The + operator can also be used to add (concatenate) strings.
	Example:
		let text1 = "Ravi";
		let text2 = "Kumar";
		console.log (text1 + " " + text2);
		
The += assignment operator can also be used to add (concatenate) strings:
	Example:
		let text1 = "Ravi";
		console.log (text1 += "kumar");
		
		let x = "surya";
		let y = "chandra";
		console.log(x + y); //suryachandra
		x+=y; // y is added to x and result is stored in x.
		console.log(x);// suryachandra
		console.log(x + y);//suryachandrachandra
----
Adding Strings and Numbers
	Adding two numbers, will return the sum, but adding a number and a string 
	will return a string:
	Example:
		let x = 5 + 5;
		let y = "5" + 5;
		let z = "Hello" + 5;
			console.log(x,y,z);

	+=		x += y	x = x + y
	-=		x -= y	x = x - y
	*=		x *= y	x = x * y

	**=		x **=y	x = x ** y
