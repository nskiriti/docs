What is Angular?
	Angular is a javascript framework, which is backed by google, which allows 
	us to create a single page applications.
--
What is SPA?
	SPA is basically a web application where all functionalities are framed on 
	a single page.
	SPA has only one HTML file and bunch of html templates, javascript and css 
	files.
	In SPA, all the html templates, css and javascript files are rendered on 
	the same page dynamically.
	User can navigate different sections of the page by clicking on links or 
	buttons without reloading the page.
	It looks like as a mobile application, they give better user experience.

What is difference between AngularJs and Angular?
	Language
		AngularJS uses JavaScript language, which is a dynamically typed 
		language.
		Angular uses TypeScript language, which is a statically typed language 
		and is a superset of JavaScript.
	Mobile Support
		AngularJS does not provide mobile support.
		Angular is supported by all popular mobile browsers.
	Version
		AngularJs was introduced in 2010. it is written in JavaScript, It is 
		also called as Angular1.
		Angular framework was introduced in 2016, it uses TypeScript as 
		programming language.
		It is completely rewritten framework, it is not related with AngularJs.
			We are calling it as Angular2.
			Angular2
			Angular3 xxx
			Angular4
			...
			...
			Angular10
			Angular11
			Angular12
			Angular13
			Angular14
	Architecture
	AngularJs uses MVC or Model-View-Controller architecture.
		View shows data to the users.
		Controller gets the data from Model, it process the data and exposes 
		data to view.
		Model contains the business logic.
		Angular replaces controllers with components.
		Components are nothing but directives with a predefined template.

What is the difference between javascript and typescript?
	Typescript is a superset of Javascript.
	Javascript runs in the browser indirectly, compilation phase is not 
	required.
	Typescript won't run in the browser directly, it requires compilation phase.
	TSC compiler will takes .ts file as an input and generates the .js file as 
	an output.
	Angular uses the Ahead-Of-time (AOT) compiler.

--
What is package.json file contains?
	What are the packages/libraries that we are using into our angular project 
those are registered into package.json files with version information.
	package.json contains version information but not packages/libraries.
	Angular packages: Angular core and optional modules; their package names 
	begin @angular/.
		Ex:  @angular/core, @angular/forms, @angular/router, @angular/compiler

How an angular app gets started and loaded?
	When an angular app gets served, couples of CSS and JavaScript files are 
	imported into the index.html by the Angular CLI.
	One of the important file imported into index.html file is main.ts file.
	In main.ts file, we bootstrap the root module app.module.ts file.
	In app.module.ts file, we bootstrap the root component app.component.ts 
	file.
	In app.component.ts file, root-selector, template and style are configured. 
	In index.html file, the root-selector is configured. So that angular 
	framework 
	will loads the app.component.ts element dynamically into index.html.
	index.html >> main.ts >> app.module.ts >> app.component.ts >> index.html>>  
	app.component.html 
--
What are components?
	Components are a key features in angular, you build your whole application 
	by composing it from a couple of components which you create in your own.
	root component is app component.
	Each component has its own templates
	We can use components more than once.
--
What is app module?
	An Application Module is a logical container for coordinated objects related
	to a particular task, with optional programming logic.
	Angular uses components to build web pages and uses modules to basically 
	bundle different pieces.
--
What is data binding?
	Basically translate data binding with communication.
	Communication between typescript code of component and the template(HTML).
--
How to create
25 data binding
	HTML Template	<--		Typescript
		String Interpolation
			Syntax: {{ data/(typescript expression) }}
		Property Binding
			Syntax: [Property] = "data/(typescript expression)"
	--
	HTML Template	-->		Typescript
		Event Binding
			Syntax: (event) = "experience" 
	--
	HTML Template	<-->	Typescript
		Two-Way-Binding
			Syntax: [(ngModel)]="data"
--
What is interceptor?
	This is a unique type angular service.
	We can implement interceptors allow us intercept incoming or outgoing HTTP 
	requests using the HTTPClient.
--
What are Directives?
	Directives are instructions in the DOM!
	Directives are used to manipulate the DOM.
	By using directives, you can change the appearance, behavior or a layout of 
	a DOM element. It also helps you to extend HTML.
Types of Directives
	Components Directives
		Component directives are used in main class. 
		They contain the detail of how the component should be processed, 
		instantiated and used at runtime.
	--
	Structural Directives
		Structural directives start with a * sign. These directives are used to 
		manipulate and change the structure of the DOM elements. 
		Example: 
		*ngIf, *ngSwitch, and *ngFor.
	--
	Attribute Directives
		Attribute directives are used to change the look and behavior of the 
		DOM elements. 
		Example: ngClass and ngStyle etc
--
What is Dependency Injection?
	By using angular DI to increase the flexibility and modularity in your 
	application.
--
What is difference between JIT and AOT?
	jit and AOT both are same compilers 
	JIT-just in time
	jit compiles your application in the browser at run time. it is suitable for
	local development. 
	and each file compiled separately.
	AOT- Ahead-of- time
	 it compiled by the machine itself using cli
	 all code compiled together.suitable for production builds.
--
What is pipes?
	It takes data as input transform into output.
What is lazy loading?
What is view encapsulation?
	The template and style defined within the component can effect the whole 
	application or vice versa. Angular provides three encapsulation strategies.
	They are
		1.Emulated -> Styles from the main HTML propagate to the component.
		2.Native-> Styles from the main HTML don't propagate to the component.
		3.None->Styles from the component propagate back to the main HTML and 
		therefore it visible for all components on the page.

What is difference between TDF and Reactive forms?
Template Driven Forms:--> 
	It used in simple forms like login page. with two way data binding.
	We can simply assign value to variable from ui and vice versa.

	Easy to use
	Suitable for simple scenarios and fails for complex scenarios
	Similar to AngularJS
	Two way data binding(using [(NgModel)] syntax)
	Minimal component
	Automatic track of the form and its data(handled by Angular)
	Unit testing is another challenge.
	
	Simple example is if we are giving two way binding for the below input.
	<input [(ngModel)]="username">
	
	We can simply display the value that user is giving in the UI.
	<p>Hello {{username}}!</p>
	
Reactive forms:-->
	Complex forms with more number of fields.
	Multiple complex validation are there. Custom validations are required.
	Require JSON structure to be send with the values in the form.
	
	More flexible, but needs a lot of practice

	Handles any complex scenarios
	More component code and less HTML markup
	Reactive transformations can be made possible such as
	Handling a event based on a debounce time
	Handling events when the components are distinct until changed
	Adding elements dynamically
	Easier unit testing.

What is module?
 	Collection of components is called module, which can perform specific task.
How to check the rest url is working or not?

What is difference between null and undefined in Javascript?
	Undefined: It means a variable declared, but no value has been assigned a 
	value.
	var demo;
	alert(demo); //shows undefined
	Null:
	var demo = null;
	alert(demo); //shows null
How to invoke the rest services in angular?
	by using httpclient module.

What is difference between promise and observable?
 Observable: 
	Observable is a synchronized (sequential). 
	Once you initiate the request we can cancel the request. 
	We will use observables to retrieve large volume of data like arrays, 
	collections, map and list. 
Promise:
	Promise is an asynchronous (parallel)
	Once you initiate the request we cannot cancel the request.
	We will use promise for to retrieve single value or error message.

What is difference between synchronous and asynchronous?
	Synchronous: If your calling one rest request it will wait until execution 
	completes.
	Asynchronous: you can call multiple rest requests parallelly.  

How to execute some logic the time of component load or page load?
	Implement the OnInit class and override the ngOnit method.
How to call rest services?
	Create a service package and service classes and add the service classes in 
	the in the provider section of app.module.ts 
	Use the HttpClient angular library and request methods.
What is angular life cycle?
	Angular calls lifecycle hook methods on directives and components as it 
	creates, changes, and destroys them.
	OnInit
	ngOnInit
  	
If I want to execute some logic at time of class initialization in angular?

	Angular project with an @import keywords.
	Adding the Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript files in the styles and scripts 
	arrays of the angular.json file of your project
	
How many angular form approaches there?
	Template driven forms and reactive forms

How to choose the angular form approach?

	Reactive Forms: reactive forms are most robust, scalable, testable and 
	reusable. It is using small login forms. 
	It is used to reactive formModules.
	Template-Driven Forms: Template driven forms are used in basic form 
	requirements and logic that can be managed solely in the template.
	Template driven forms are good fit for bigger applications. It mostly uses 
	in directives. And formModule.

What are the difference between TDF and RF? 
	Template-driven forms make use of the "FormsModule", while reactive forms 
	are based on "ReactiveFormsModule".
	Template-driven forms are asynchronous in nature, whereas Reactive forms 
	are mostly synchronous.

What is difference between mutable and immutable?

	Template driven forms are unstructured and mutable and reactive forms are 
	structured and immutable. 
	
Can we access TDF values without using  ViewChild?

	yes we can access 

	form.value.firstName

What is difference between dirty-touch and in-valid in TDF? 
	If you are touched and enter the value is dirty in that dirty is error then 
	become a invalid.
	1. Touched 
	2. Dirty
	3. Invalid
	The difference between touched and dirty is that with touched the user 
	doesn't need to actually change the value of the input control.

What is wildcard entry's in Angular?
	The wildcards routes is basically used for invalid URLs, then by default 404 page not found error is displayed.
	A Wildcard route has a path consisting of two asterisks (**).
	the syntax is
	{
	path:'**', component: errorcomponent
	};
Can you describe the MVVM architecture?
	view means HTML templates, view model means component typescript classes 
	and model means typescript service classes.
	ex: create.employee.html --> view.
	create.employee.ts -->view model.
	EmployeeService.ts-->>model.
