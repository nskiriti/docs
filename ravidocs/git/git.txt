VCS Version Controlling System
	CVS - SVN - GIT
Problems without VCS?
Problem 1:
	Code in Local Machine, if system got crashed, we will lose code.
Problem 2:
	If two persons working on same file at a time, very difficult to merge.
Problem 3:
	If we are creating files like versions like v1, v2, v3 etc.., it is very 
	difficult to maintain
==
What is Version Control System?
	We can track changes that happen within directories of files
==
VCS Goals
	Allow developers to work simultaneously and collabratively
	Do not overwrite
	Maintain History of every changes.
==
VCS Types
Centralized
	Client - Server Model
	Ex: CVS, SVN
Distributed
	Client  - Local - Server[github] Model
	Working Directory -> Local Repository -> Remote Repository
Ex: GIT, bitbucket
==
Central VCS
	Central -> User1, User2, User3
		Cons:
		If there is connection issues b/w local and remote, we can’t go further.
==	
Distributed VCS
	Distributed1/Remote1 -> Local1, Local2, Local3 -> User1, User2, User3
	Pros:
		If there is connection issues we can work with local VCS.
		Once connection will works, we can work on Distributed1/Remote1

What is GIT?
Installed locally on the developer machine
Working Directory
Staging Area
Git Directory
Installation
//TODO
Work with GIT
	CLI
	GUI
	VSCODE

To move untrack file from WA to SA
git commit –m “comments”
To commit the changes from SA to GR
git log
Shows the logs
git revert id
To go previous version
git reset id
--
Login into github, create repository
git config -global user.name “user1”
git config -global user.email user1@mail.com

git remote add origin https://github.com/user1/gitdemo.git
git push –u origin master
	it moves readme.txt to github
--
Add some lines in readme.txt
git status
git add readme.txt
git commit –m “comments”
--
Get the changes from the github
