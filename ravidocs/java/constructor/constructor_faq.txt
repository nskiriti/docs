What is constructor?
The constructor is a special method.
It has to have the exact name as "ClassName".
It is executed automatically when a new object is creating.
It is used to initialize object properties.
--
syntax:
    ClassName() {}
	
    ClassName(type org1, type org2, type org3) {
        this.prop1 = org1;
        this.prop2 = org2;
        this.prop3 = org3;
    }
 
Example:

    public Employees() {}
    
    public Employees(int employeeId, String email, int phoneNumber) {
        this.employeeId = employeeId;
        this.email = email;
        this.phoneNumber = phoneNumber;
    }
Rules to write constructors:
Rule 1
Name of the constructor and name of the class must be same.
Example:
	class Employees {
	public Employees() {
		System.out.println("No org Constructor");
	}
--
Rule 2
Return type concept is not applicaable for constructor even void also.
If we are declaring the return type for the constructor, we don't get any
compile time error and run time error, compiler simply treats it as a 
method.
    Example:
    class Employees {
	public Employees() {
		System.out.println("This is no org Constructor");
	}
	public void Employees() {
		System.out.println("This is method");
	}
}
It is legal to have a method name is exaclty same as a class name, but not 
recomended.
Rule 3
applicable modifiers for the constructor are public, default, private, 
protected. If we are using any other modifier we will get compile time error.
==
default constructor:
    compiler added constrctor in .class file is called as a default constructor.
    If developer won't write atleast one constructor in .java file, 
    then java compiler will add default constructor in .class file at the time 
    of compilcation time.
    syntax:
    ClassName() {
        //NO Code here
    }
Example:
public class Employees {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.println("This is main method");
		Employees employees = new Employees();
	}
}
no org constructor:
    developer added constrctor in .java file without arguments is called no org 
    constructor.
    if developer writes atleat one constructor in .java file, then java 
    compiler won't adds a default constructor in .class file.
    syntax:
     syntax:
    ClassName() {
        //Write code here
    }
Example:
public class Employees {
    Employees() {
        System.out.println("This is no org constructor");
    }
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.println("This is main method");
		Employees employees = new Employees();
	}
}
org constructor:
