Why we need to use conditional statements?
	Conditional statements are used to perform different actions based on 
	different conditions.
--
What are the conditional statements?
	if
	if-else
	else-if ladder 
	switch case
--
What is if statement?
	if the specified condition is true, then only if block of code will execute.
Syntax:
	if(condition) {
	// true condition block of code
	}
Example:
	if(age>=18) {
		//write a logic for applying voter card
	}
--
What is else statement?
if the specified condition is false, then only else block of code will execute.
Syntax:
	if(condition) {
	// condition true block of code
	} else {
		//condition not true block of code
	}
Example:
	if(age >= 18) {
		//write a logic for applying voter card
	} else {
		//Write a logic to show information to the user
	}
What is else if statement?
	else if statement is used to specify a new condition.
	if the condition is true, it will execute if block.
	if the condition is false, it will execute else block.
Syntax:
	if(condition1) {
	// if condition1 true block of code
	} else if (condition2) {
		//else if condition2 true block of code
	} else {
		//if all condition not true block of code 
	}
Example:
	if(class<=5) {
		//Go to Primary school
	} else if (class<=10){
		//Go to High school
	} else if (class<=12) {
		//GO to inter college
	} else if (class<=15) {
		//GO to degree college
	} else {
		//GO to PG college
	}
What is switch case?
if you want to check more condtions [more than 4], its better to use switch 
instead of else if ladder.

Difference between else if ladder and switch?
