Why do we need loops?
	To execute the logic repeatedly.
What are the typs of loops?
for
	loops through a block of code number of times.
for/in
	loops through the properties of an object. 
for/of
	loops through the values of an array. 
while
	loops through a block of code if the specified condition is true.
	If the the condition is true then only executes the block of code.
do/while
	loops through a block of code if the specified condition is true.
	It will executes the block of code at least once and checks the condition.
== Stop it here
For
	Syntax:
	for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
		// write your code here..., may be single line or 100 lines
		// getEmployee();
		// it will execute multiple times based upon the the condition
	}
	Example:
	for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
		console.log("This is my logic i want to execute 10 times"+i);
	}
	const employees = ["Steven", "Neena", "Lex", "Alexander", "David", "Valli"];
	for (let i = 0 ; i < employees.length; i++) {
		console.log(employees[i]);
	}
	// array index = 5 length = 6;
	// index = length - 1;
==
What is for In?
	for in statement loops through the properties of an Object.
Syntax:
	for (property in object) {
			// code block to be executed
	}
Example:
	function forLoop4() { 
		const employee = {employeeId: "101",firstName: "Ravi",lastName:"Pagidi"0;  
		let text = "";
		for (let property in employee) {
			text += employee[property] + "<br>";
		}
		document.getElementById("cars").innerHTML = text;
	}
----
What is For Of?
for of statement loops through the values of an iterable object.
Syntax:
	for (value of iterable) {
		// code block to be executed
	}
Example:
	function forLoop5() {
	const employees = ["Steven", "Neena", "Lex"];
	let text = "";
	for (let employee of employees) {
		text += car + "<br>";
	}
	document.getElementById("cars").innerHTML = text;
   }
