two way data binding in react JS:
----------------------------------------------------------

Whatever we store the information or data in another place we have to show that data. It is called Data binding.
It is 2 types.
1. One-way data binding:
-> We have to show the data in DOM/HTML after storing it in the Js file or update the value in js when we update the value in HTML.
2. Two-way data binding:
-> When we update in js it should be effect in html or if we update the value in html it should be update in js also.

--> Using the state concept we can achieve the one-way data binding.
--> State concept is compulsory to achieve the one-way data binding.
-> In React by default it is not possible to update the javascript value when we update the value in html.
--> We have to update the state value to achieve two-way data binding.
