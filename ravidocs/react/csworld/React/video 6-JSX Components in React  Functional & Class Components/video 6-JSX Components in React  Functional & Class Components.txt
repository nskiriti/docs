NOTES: video 6-Functional Components & Class in React
Date: 16/oct/2024 ! CS world Telugu!

In this Video lets deep dive into components of React JS. Basically, ReactJS is a component based library. so we develop multiple components and all these form to be one single application.

Q.What is component?
It is a Javascript file. [(HTML + JS)+ CSS], as per requirement we divide our application into small components. then develop these components individually.

Header component
NavBar component
Footer component
content component
Aside component

In traditional development without React, we write all the above mentioned components as tags in same HTML file, but in React we create seperate components. CSS can be seperate file or In-line.

Types of components:
1. Functional Components
2. Class Components

what is the crux of React? 
writing HTML in Javascript is the main part of react. so, using function and writing HTML code is functional component. so, using Class and writing HTML code is Class component.

2.index.js = root JS file.
1.index.html = root HTML file.

Q.How to write a functional component in JSX?

function Header(){
 return(
		<ul>
			<li>Home</li>
			<li>About</li>
			<li>Contact US</li>
		</ul>)
 }
 
 root.render(<Header/>) ==> most preferred
 or root.render(Header())
 
 we can export Header function and import it in any other component, and use it by calling <header/>
 
Q.How to use Javascript in JSX syntax?
 
 function Header(){
  let menus = ['Home', 'About','Contact US' ]
 return(
		<Header>
		<ul>
			<li>{menus[0]}</li>
			<li>{menus[1]}</li>
			<li>{menus[2]}</li>
		</ul>
			</header>)
 }
 
 root.render(<Header/>)
 
Q. What is Class Components?

Class components in react uses render() function from react library. and extends a Component class to current custom class from React library(React.Component)

Syntax:

class className extends React.Components {
	render(){
	let menus = ['Home', 'About','Contact US' ];
		return (
		<Header>
		<ul>
			<li>{menus[0]}</li>
			<li>{menus[1]}</li>
			<li>{menus[2]}</li>
		</ul>
			<Header/>)
		)
	}
}

root.render(<className/>)
	
Note: React.Components => new class created refers to the extended class of components in react library. thus new class behavior is derived predefined methods and properties of component class in React.
