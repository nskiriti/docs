1. Why are you switching to IT from Mechanical Domain?

Mechanical Domain - End user of SAP, I faced few challenges while uploading daily production reports. I advised few changes with support team, they were accepted

In Amazon, I was gathering the fraud patterns and advising the development team and business analytics team to make changes accordingly. Which minimized work load on investigations team.

Working closely with IT team, I developed interest in IT domain. Few experienced managers from IT advised that I would fit well within Business analytics team.
