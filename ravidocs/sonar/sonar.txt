what is SonarLint?
SonarLint is a free and open-source IDE plugin for static code analysis.  It is the first line of defense, designed to detect coding issues in real-time. many code attributes, such as maintainability, reliability, and security issues are checked.

Sonarâ€™s IDE extensions are available for IntelliJ (and other JetBrains IDEs), Visual Studio, VS Code, and Eclipse, and can be installed directly from your IDE's plugin marketplace. 

The Sonar solution is designed to help you achieve a state of Clean Code, that is, code whose attributes make your software secure, reliable, and maintainable. Security, reliability, and maintainability are called software qualities.
