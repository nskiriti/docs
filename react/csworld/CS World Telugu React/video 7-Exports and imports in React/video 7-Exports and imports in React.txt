The Overall topic is.
2 types of export Components are there.
1. Named export. If we have to import a named export component we have to use {} in the js file.
2. Default export. If it is there easily we can import it. Curly braces are not required. We can use any name.
3. Whenever we import a particular component compulsory the first letter should be in upper case.
4. In One component only one time we can do export default.
5. We have to use the Tag format component in the App.js file.
6. Whenever we import any component we have to give the exact path otherwise directly it will search in the node_modules folder.
Good Explanation.

import React , { Component } from 'react'
import nnnn,{detail as p} from "./object"
import "./index.scss"

  class Componentclass2 extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
       {console.log(p,nnnn)}
      </div>
    )
  }
}
