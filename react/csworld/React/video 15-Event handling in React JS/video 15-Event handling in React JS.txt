Overall synopsis:
•	An event is generally an action. Action may be taken by the user or system. The user or the system will perform some action, and after that, we have to perform some action. This is called event handling.
•	We have two types of events: one is a system-generated event, and the other is a user-generated event.
•	For example, the loading of a web page is a system-generated event. After loading, we have to show some data on the web page generated by the user.
•	Ex in html: <button onclick="displayMessage()"> Click</button>
•	Ex in React (JSX): <button onClick={displayMessage}> Click</button> 
•	Rules:
•	We have to follow the camel case convention for writing event names in React.
•	We have to write function names only in curly braces when using events in React. We don’t call the function. If we write like this, it is immediately executed.
•	If we need to send parameters immediately, we can write them as anonymous or arrow functions.
•	It is not immediately executed. It is executed by the system, but normal functions are immediately executed.
•	If the input is not required, then we can write the direct function name in the event place.
•	We can send event information to the event location.
