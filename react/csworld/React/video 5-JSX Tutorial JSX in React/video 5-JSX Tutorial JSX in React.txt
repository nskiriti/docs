NOTES: video 5-JSX in Reactjs Date: 16/oct/2024 ! CS world Telugu!

The basic functionality of react is to write HTML in Javascript. How do we write? using react methods. but there is a difficulty in implementing those methods by developer(3rd example below), so they came up with JS-extension, also popularly known as Javascript Xml. so, jsx is a syntax extension to javascript.

using only HTML
---------------
  <ul>
	<li>Home</li>
	<li>About</li>
  </ul>
  
using only Javascript
---------------
let ul = document.createElement("ul");
let li1 = document.createElement('li1');
li1.innerText = "Home";
let li2 = document.createElement("li2");
li2.innerText = "About";
ul.appendChild('li1');
ul.appendChild('li2');
document.body.appendChild('ul');

using only React
----------------
let li1 = React.createElement(li,{},Home);
let li2 = React.createElement(li,{},About);
let ul = React.createElement(ul,{},[li1, li2]);
let root = ReactDom.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
root.render(ul);

using JSX
---------
let menu = (
			<ul>
				<li>Home</li>
				<li>About</li>
			</ul>)
let root = ReactDom.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
root.render(menu);

In the above method, we used HTML like syntax in javascript file = JSX;
this is not HTML; this is not Javascript;
Browser cannot understand this JSX, it takes Babel(js file, package) to convert it back to react actual methods(ex.3); then React creates virtual DOM to render on browser. This is simplified method to write the code using JSX.

#TODO
try using JSX to React code compilations in browser ready tools. => Babel
ex.4 to ex3
so, basically JSX-->Babel==>React way of creating elements-->other react libraries==> browser understandable like document.createElementBy('id');

How to include javascript in JSX?
 
let name = "csworld";
let menu = (
			<ul>
				<li>{name}</li>
				<li>About</li>
			</ul>)
let root = ReactDom.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
root.render(menu);
javascript has to be written in {}. without curly braces its just a string.
we need not use "()" unless, we start <ul> right after "=" symbol. but it is always recomemnded to use () after return statement in function or any variable like menu here.

How to include attributes in JSX?

Since this is not HTML but it is a HTML like syntax, we need to follow few predefined rules.
for ex: class in HTML is className in JSX.
These attributes in React are called PROPS.

How to write a functional component in JSX?

function functionName(){
 return(
		<div>
			<p>Para1</p>
			<p>Para2</p>
		</div>)
 }
 
 root.render(<functionName/>)
 
 Functional and class components will be discussed seperately in further videos.
