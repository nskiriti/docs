The Overall topic is.
2 types of export Components are there.
1. Named export. If we have to import a named export component we have to use {} in the js file.
2. Default export. If it is there easily we can import it. Curly braces are not required. We can use any name.
3. Whenever we import a particular component compulsory the first letter should be in upper case.
4. In One component only one time we can do export default.A module cannot have multiple default exports.
5. We have to use the Tag format component in the App.js file.
6. Whenever we import any component we have to give the exact path otherwise directly it will search in the node_modules folder.


--------------
1) 00:00:00 --explain why we use import and export concept.
	Exports and Imports are not React specific. React is JS library, so exports and imports fall under JS. Introduced from ES6 version. We basically export a piece of code or component from one js file to another by importing. 
	
2) 00:01:00 -- why we use import and export concept in reactjs.
	increases reusability.
	
3) 00:01:33--Node_modules contains javascript libraries and used whenever we import them on our JS file. 

import React from 'react'; [after FROM we need to give path, instead if we give file name, then search will be done in node modules, where it is exported in first place]

4) 00:02:03 -- we can use same or different different naming (named export and default export)
	default export: if a function or class or object or component or array or string is default exported and then we can import by using any name.
	Named Export: we need to use same name while importing 

5) 00:02:50 -- create a object in seperate file.
6) 00:03:30 -- explain about export.

APP.js(named export)
-------------------

export let person = {name: "raju",
			  Place: "hyd",
			  age: 27}
			  
export let x = 10;			  
			 
INDEX.js
--------
import {person, x} from './APP.js'

----------------------------------------------------------------------


APP.js(default export)
----------------------
export default let person = {name: "raju",
			  Place: "hyd",
			  age: 27}
			  
		 
INDEX.js
--------
import Nnnn from './APP.js' ==> right
import person from './APP.js' ==> right

 explaination about console.log(gh) --output--error; console.log(person without{}---error) works only imported with {person}, since person is named exported initially. console.log(x) also works since x is comma seperated in import statement within {};

Alias Names:
------------
APP.js(named export)
-------------------

export let person = {name: "raju",
			  Place: "hyd",
			  age: 27}
			  
export let x = 10;			  
			 
INDEX.js
--------
import {person as p, x} from './APP.js'
console.log(p)=== console.log(person)
---------------------------------------------------------------------- 
A module cannot have multiple default exports.
for named exports curly braces and alias names; for default exports alias names or its name will work.

import x,{person} from './APP.js ==> 1 default and 1 named export.
alias name can be used instead of x, and in this imported file, exported default x can be pointed out as y.

Q. WHy do we need Export and Import in React?

import React from 'react.js'; => React is an object default exported in 'react.js' present in node_modules.
import ReactDom from 'react-dom/client';=> ReactDom is an object default exported in 'react-dom/client.js' present in node_modules.

import React from 'react.js' === import x from 'react.js';
import ReactDom from 'react-dom/client' === import y from 'react-dom/client'

Whenever we import a particular component compulsory the first letter should be in upper case.

general practice is that,in Index.js we root.render(<APP/>) and all other components are called in App.js, in App.js we create a function by name APP and in its return statement we call multiple components in single <div> or use fragments.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------




note:we have two types of exports: named export and default export 
(1) default export name for single file we use only single time.
(2) named export concept we use for multible times in single file so due to that only we have two types of exports are present.

code snippet
import React , { Component } from 'react'
import nnnn,{detail as p} from "./object"
import "./index.scss"

  class Componentclass2 extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
       {console.log(p,nnnn)}
      </div>
    )
  }
}
export default Componentclass2;
// close tag for react on right side  
// 1)<label/>
// close tag for html react element on left side 
// 2)</label>
export let Detail ={
  name:"lokesh",
  age:"25",
  village:"pathagunta"
}

let Detail1 ={
  name:"murali",
  age:"25",
  village:"pathagunta"
}

export default detail1;
