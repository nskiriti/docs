1. why front end frameworks choosing Typescript over the Javascript?

Front-end frameworks increasingly favor **TypeScript over JavaScript** because of its **stronger type system, improved developer experience, and maintainability benefits**. Here’s why:  

### **1. Type Safety & Fewer Bugs**  
- TypeScript provides **static typing**, catching errors **during development** instead of at runtime.  
- It helps prevent common mistakes like **undefined properties or incorrect function arguments**, making applications more robust.  

### **2. Better Developer Experience (DX)**  
- **IntelliSense & Autocompletion**: Editors like VS Code offer **better autocompletion and inline documentation**.  
- **Refactoring & Code Navigation**: TS makes it easier to rename variables, track types, and refactor code safely.  

### **3. Scalability & Maintainability**  
- In large applications, TypeScript helps teams **define clear contracts** between different parts of the codebase.  
- Reduces **technical debt** by making sure future developers understand expected types and data structures.  

### **4. Improved Code Quality & Readability**  
- With TypeScript, teams write **self-documenting code**, reducing the need for excessive comments or external documentation.  
- Enforces **consistent coding patterns**, which is especially useful for large teams.  

### **5. Popular Frameworks Use TypeScript**  
- **React, Angular, Vue, Next.js, Svelte, and Solid.js** have all embraced TypeScript.  
- Some frameworks like **Angular** are TypeScript-first, making TS the default choice.  

### **6. Backward Compatibility with JavaScript**  
- TypeScript is a **superset of JavaScript**, meaning all JavaScript code is valid TypeScript.  
- Developers can gradually adopt TypeScript without rewriting the entire codebase.  

### **7. Tooling & Ecosystem**  
- **ESLint + TypeScript** enables better linting and static analysis.  
- **Strong community support** and many open-source libraries now offer built-in TypeScript definitions.  

### **Conclusion**  
While JavaScript remains widely used, **TypeScript is becoming the preferred choice for modern front-end frameworks** due to its improved reliability, maintainability, and developer experience. It helps teams write **cleaner, safer, and more scalable** code.  


2. Is Javascript and ECMA script both same?

No, **JavaScript and ECMAScript are not exactly the same**, but they are closely related.  

### **1. ECMAScript (ES) – The Standard**  
- **ECMAScript** (ES) is the **official specification** that defines the rules, syntax, and features of JavaScript.  
- It is maintained by **ECMA International** (a standards organization) under **ECMA-262**.  
- **Think of ECMAScript as the blueprint for JavaScript**.  

### **2. JavaScript – The Implementation**  
- **JavaScript** is a **programming language** that follows the ECMAScript specification.  
- It is implemented in browsers (like Chrome, Firefox, Edge) and environments (like Node.js).  
- **Think of JavaScript as the real-world application of ECMAScript**.  

### **3. ECMAScript Versions (ES5, ES6, etc.)**  
- New features in JavaScript come from ECMAScript updates.  
- Example:  
  - **ES5 (2009)** – `strict mode`, `JSON support`, `Array.prototype.forEach()`  
  - **ES6 (2015)** – `let/const`, `arrow functions`, `classes`, `modules`  
  - **ES7+ (2016 onward)** – `async/await`, optional chaining (`?.`), `BigInt`  

### **4. Other Implementations of ECMAScript**  
- JavaScript is the most popular ECMAScript-based language, but others exist:  
  - **ActionScript** (used in Adobe Flash)  
  - **JScript** (Microsoft’s version for IE)  

### **Conclusion**  
- **ECMAScript is the specification** that defines how JavaScript should work.  
- **JavaScript is an implementation** of ECMAScript, adding extra features like **DOM APIs, Web APIs, and event handling**.
