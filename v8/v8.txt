What is V8?
Google's open-source high-performance JavaScript and WebAssembly engine. 
Written in C++.
Used in Chrome, Node.js and among others.
Implements ECMAScript and WebAssembly.
Runs on Windows 7 or later, macOS 10.12+, and Linux systems. 
Runs on x64, IA-32, ARM, processors.
V8 can run standalone, or can be into any C++ application.

1. Overview of V8 Architecture
V8 translates JavaScript code into machine code instead of interpreting it, which contributes to its high performance. This engine has several key components that work together to optimize the execution of JavaScript.

2. Key Components of V8 Architecture
Parser: The parser reads JavaScript code and converts it into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). This is the first step in understanding the code structure.

Ignition Interpreter: The bytecode interpreter, Ignition, converts the AST into bytecode and starts executing it. It provides a baseline for running code before any optimization occurs.

Compiler Pipeline:

Full-Codegen (Legacy): This was V8â€™s original method for generating machine code directly from JavaScript but has largely been replaced by modern components.
Turbofan: The optimizing compiler that generates highly efficient machine code. Turbofan performs aggressive optimizations, inlining, and type feedback analysis to ensure faster code execution.
Liftoff: The baseline WebAssembly compiler that compiles WebAssembly code quickly with minimal optimization.
Inline Caches (IC): These caches collect type feedback at runtime to optimize frequently accessed operations. Inline caches make future operations faster by predicting how certain operations should be executed based on observed types.

Garbage Collector (Orinoco): V8 employs a garbage collector to manage memory automatically. Orinoco is V8's concurrent garbage collection system that runs in parallel with code execution to reclaim memory used by objects no longer in use.

3. Execution Flow
Parsing: The JavaScript code is parsed to generate an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
Bytecode Generation: The AST is compiled into bytecode by Ignition.
Interpretation and Profiling: Ignition interprets and runs the bytecode, collecting runtime data and type feedback.
Optimization: Based on profiling data, Turbofan recompiles sections of the code into optimized machine code.
De-optimization: If assumptions made by the optimizing compiler turn out to be incorrect, V8 de-optimizes the code and falls back to bytecode.
4. Garbage Collection (GC)
Scavenger: A simple and fast garbage collector used for new objects in the young generation.
Mark-Sweep and Mark-Compact: More comprehensive algorithms used for objects that have survived the young generation and moved to the old generation.
Incremental and Concurrent Marking: Reduces pause times by performing GC incrementally or concurrently with code execution.
5. Optimizations
Hidden Classes and Property Access: V8 uses hidden classes (similar to the concept of "classes" in other languages) to optimize property access and operations.
Just-In-Time (JIT) Compilation: The transition from interpreted bytecode to optimized machine code happens at runtime using Just-In-Time compilation for faster execution.
6. WebAssembly Integration
V8 has robust support for WebAssembly (Wasm), allowing it to execute Wasm code efficiently alongside JavaScript. The Liftoff and Turbofan compilers are used to parse, validate, and execute Wasm modules efficiently.

Summary
The V8 engine's architecture is a combination of parsing, interpretation, and optimization strategies. It uses Ignition for initial execution and Turbofan for generating optimized machine code, enhanced by inline caches and garbage collection mechanisms to improve performance and memory management.
