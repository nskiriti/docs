What is the difference between origin/main to main branch?
1. main Branch:
Local Representation: The main branch is your local branch. It's the branch 
stored and managed in your local repository.
Current State: It reflects the latest state of the branch on your local 
machine, including any changes you’ve made but not yet pushed or fetched.
Editable: You can directly commit changes to this branch and work on it.
2. origin/main Branch:
Remote Representation: origin/main is the remote tracking branch. It represents 
the state of the main branch on the remote repository (origin is the default 
name for the remote repository).
Stale Copy: This branch shows the last known state of the remote branch as of 
your last git fetch or git pull.
Read-Only: You cannot directly modify origin/main. It updates only when you 
fetch or pull changes from the remote repository.
